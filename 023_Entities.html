<!--
HTML Entities:
--------------
Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:
    &entity_name;
        OR
    &#entity_number;

NOTE :  Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.
        Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.

HTML Symbol Entities:
---------------------
HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.
To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use an HTML entity name.

If no entity name exists, you can use an entity number, a decimal, or hexadecimal reference.

What are Emojis?:
-----------------
Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

The HTML charset Attribute:
---------------------------
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:
    <meta charset="UTF-8">


What is Character Encoding?:
-----------------------------
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.

ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.

The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
