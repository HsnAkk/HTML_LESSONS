<!--
With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.

Image Maps:
-----------
The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

How Does it Work?
-----------------
The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.

The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:

The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

Create Image Map:
-----------------
Then, add a <map> element.
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute

NOTE: The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute.

The Areas:
----------
Then, add the clickable areas.
A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape:
------
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

    rect - defines a rectangular region
    circle - defines a circular region
    poly - defines a polygonal region
    default - defines the entire region

    You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image.

<!--
Shape="rect":
-------------
The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top.
The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:
-->


<!--
Shape="circle":
---------------
To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle: 337,300
Then specify the radius of the circle: 44 pixels
-->


<!--
Shape="poly":
-------------
The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
This can be used to create any shape.
We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the shape. The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis
