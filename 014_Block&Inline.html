<!--
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.
-->

<!--
Block-level Elements:
---------------------
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
------------------------------------------
<address>

<article>
<nav>
<section>
<aside>
<main>
<header>
<footer>

<blockquote>
<pre>

<div>
<p>
<h1>-<h6>

<ol>
<ul>
<li>

<table>
<tfoot>

<dl>
<dt>
<dd>

<canvas>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<video>

<form>
<fieldset>

<hr>
<noscript>
-->


<!--
Inline Elements:
----------------
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:
-------------------------------------
<a>
<button>
<img>
<input>
<label>
<select>
<textarea>
<span>
<b>
<em>
<i>
<strong>
<br>

<abbr>
<acronym>
<bdo>
<big>
<cite>
<code>
<dfn>
<kbd>
<map>
<object>
<output>
<q>
<samp>
<script>
<small>
