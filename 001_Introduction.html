    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        <p>Hello world</p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>

- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page and it defines the whole HTML document.
- The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images,   hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The <h1> element defines a large heading
- The <p> element defines a paragraph
- The <a> element defines a link

The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

What is an HTML Element?
------------------------
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
        <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>   

NOTE : Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element, which defines a line break). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML is Not Case Sensitive?
---------------------------
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase.
